--#I used SQL to query a database with 11 interrelated tables in order to analyze the data relationships and answer the following questions.

--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country<>'USA';

--Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country='Brazil';

--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, iv.InvoiceId, iv.InvoiceDate, iv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices iv
ON cust.CustomerId = iv.CustomerId
WHERE cust.Country='Brazil';

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry;

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, iv.InvoiceID, iv.Total
FROM chinook.employees emp
INNER JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.EmployeeID = cust.SupportRepID

LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices iv
ON cust.CustomerId=iv.CustomerId;

--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT cust.FirstName as CustFN, cust.LastName as CustLN, iv.BillingCountry, emp.FirstName as RepFN, emp.LastName as RepLN, iv.Total
FROM chinook.employees emp
INNER JOIN chinook.customers cust

LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices iv
ON cust.CustomerId=iv.CustomerId;

--How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT Count(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) as TotalSales
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tracks.Name, items.InvoiceLineId

--Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
